# What is Embedded Xinu?

Xinu ("Xinu is not unix", a recursive acronym) is a UNIX-like operating system originally developed by Douglas Comer for instructional purposes at Purdue University in the 1980s.

Embedded Xinu is a reimplementation of the original Xinu operating system. Xinu's ability to be lightweight has allowed for several ports to the MIPS processor, linksys routers, Rpie's and RiskV. Xinu is able to run on inexpensive wireless routers and is suitable for courses and research in the areas of Operating Systems, Hardware Systems, Embedded Systems, Networking, and Compilers.
